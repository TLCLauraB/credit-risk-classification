## Introduction: 
In this challenge, I used various techniques learned in Module 20 to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The course provided the dataset and was based on historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company. I used this to build a model that could identify the creditworthiness of its borrowers. 

## Workflow:
There was no ETL necessary for this assignment, everything was prepared for me and ready, provided by the starter code.

I received support from my fellow Data Viz classmates during class time, through Slack and via our Discord server. I regularly attended both before and after-class office hours to engage my Instructor and TAs. I reviewed the provided syllabus for Module 20.1 and 20.2 as well as the accompanying class work and instructor examples.

## Analysis:
Based on the provided data, the model that I built has a 99% accuracy for predicting both Healthy Loans (Group 1) and High-Risk Loans (Group 2).
